# Purpose
Use this repo to manage my config files

# How to use
1. Create the folders to hold these config files, in my case, it's `~/fast/dotfiles`
2. For each of the config file in your home folder, that want to manage using
   git, you can run `shiftDotFile.sh FILE_NAME`, there FILE_NAME is the file 
   name you want to manage. It will move the file into the config file forder,
   and put an symbolic link in its origin place.
